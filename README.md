# Super-Mega Search

A website to aggregate knowledge search for an organization.

## What? How?

It runs search API functions on several platforms (okay, just slack and mediawiki), and aggregates the results.

You need to create `config/super-mega.yml`, `config/credentials.yml.enc` and 'config/locales/super-mega.en.yml' (or whatever language you want to support). See example files with similar names.
